# Automated QA Assistant

A comprehensive QA automation tool that helps engineers and developers analyze files, generate test cases, and Genarate automation scripts using AI-powered analysis.

## Features

### üìÅ File Analysis
- **Multi-format Support**: Upload audio (MP3, WAV), video (MP4), images, PDFs, DOCX, or text files
- **AI-powered Summarization**: Uses Groq LLM to analyze and summarize extracted content
- **Automated Test Case Generation**: Generate comprehensive test cases based on content analysis
- **Export Options**: Download results in PDF, TXT, and JSON formats

### Automated Tests
- **Playwright Integration**: Run pre-built tests on SauceDemo.com(Scripts running part its not working properly due AI API Key which I used is free version)
- **Local Execution**: All tests run locally with no external dependencies
- **Result Tracking**: View detailed test results and screenshots

### üíæ Local Storage
- **Project-based Organization**: All data stored locally in `ProjectStorage/` directory
- **Privacy-focused**: No data sent to external servers (except for AI features)
- **Structured Output**: Organized project folders with main documentation

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tesseract OCR (for image text extraction)
- FFmpeg (for audio/video processing)

### Installation
1. Add folder in VS code then activate the .venv 
  1.  python -m venv .venv                                                                                                                                               
  2.  .venv\Scripts\activate                                                                                                                                                  

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

4. **Set up Tesseract OCR**
   - **Windows**: Download and install from [GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - **macOS**: `brew install tesseract`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

### Configuration

#### For AI Features (Optional)
1. Get a Groq API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Set the API key in one of these ways:
   - **Environment variable**: `export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here`
   - **Streamlit secrets**: Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with `GROQ_API_KEY = "your_key_here"`
   - **UI Configuration**: Enter the key in the app's sidebar

#### For Basic Features
- No API key required! File extraction and automated tests work immediately.

## Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

### File Analysis Workflow
1. Navigate to "File Analysis" in the sidebar
2. Upload a supported file (MP3, WAV, MP4, PDF, DOCX)
3. The system will automatically:
   - Extract text from the file
   - Generate AI-powered summary (if API key configured)
   - Create test cases (if API key configured)
4. Download results in your preferred format

### Automated Testing
1. Navigate to "Automated Tests" in the sidebar
2. Click "Run Automated Tests"
3. View results and screenshots
