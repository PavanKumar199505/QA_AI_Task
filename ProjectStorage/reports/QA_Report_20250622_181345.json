Overview\nThis document specifies the functional requirements for the SauceDemo web application, a demo e-commerce platform designed for testing automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Playwright). The application simulates an online shopping experience with user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and checkout processes.\n2. Main Features\nLogin Screen: A secure login page with fields for username and password, supporting multiple user types for testing scenarios.\nProduct Catalog: A browsable inventory displaying product names, descriptions, prices, images, and \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d buttons, with sorting options by name (A-Z, Z-A) and price (low to high, high to low).\nShopping Cart View: A cart page listing added products with options to remove items, continue shopping, or proceed to checkout, including a badge showing item count.\nCheckout Process: A multi-step checkout with:\nCustomer information form (first name, last name, postal code).\nOrder overview summarizing items, prices, and total (with tax).\nConfirmation screen displaying a success message.\nNavigation Menu: A sidebar menu with links for \u201cAll Items,\u201d \u201cAbout\u201d (external Sauce Labs page), \u201cLogout,\u201d and \u201cReset App State.\u201d\nSocial Media Links: Footer links to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn for external engagement.\n3. User Actions\nLogin: Users can log in with valid or invalid credentials, with distinct behaviors for different user types (standard, locked-out, problem, performance glitch).\nBrowse Products: Users can view the product catalog, sort items by name or price, and access product details.\nManage Cart: Users can add multiple products to the cart, remove items, and view the cart\u2019s contents.\nCheckout: Users can fill out the checkout information form, review the order summary, and submit to complete the order.\nNavigate: Users can access the sidebar menu to return to the inventory, visit the About page, log out, or reset the application state.\nInteract with Social Links: Users can click footer links to visit social media pages.\n4. Edge Cases\nInvalid Credentials: Attempting login with incorrect username/password displays an error message (e.g., \u201cUsername and password do not match\u201d).\nLocked-Out User: Login attempt with locked_out_user displays a specific error (e.g., \u201cSorry, this user has been locked out\u201d).\nProblem User: Login with problem_user triggers UI issues (e.g., broken images or incorrect product data) for testing.\nPerformance Glitch User: Login with performance_glitch_user simulates delays (5\u201310 seconds) for performance testing.\nEmpty Cart Checkout: Attempting checkout with an empty cart displays an appropriate error or prevents progression.\nInvalid ZIP Code: Entering an invalid postal code (e.g., empty or non-numeric) in the checkout form triggers a validation error.\nNetwork Failure: Simulating network issues during order submission displays a retry option or error message.\n5. Credentials for Testing\nThe following credentials are provided for testing different scenarios:\nStandard User:\nUsername: standard_user\nPassword: secret_sauce\nBehavior: Full access to all features.\nLocked-Out User:\nUsername: locked_out_user\nPassword: secret_sauce\nBehavior: Denied access with a locked-out error.\nProblem User:\nUsername: problem_user\nPassword: secret_sauce\nBehavior: Experiences UI or functional issues (e.g., broken images).\nPerformance Glitch User:\nUsername: performance_glitch_user\nPassword: secret_sauce\nBehavior: Simulates slow response times.\n6. Acceptance Criteria\nAll main features (login, product catalog, cart, checkout, navigation, social links) are functional and accessible with standard_user.\nUser actions are consistently executable across supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).\nEdge cases are handled with clear, actionable error messages or expected behaviors.\nTest credentials enable distinct testing scenarios as described.\nUI elements include unique identifiers (IDs/classes) for automation testing reliability.\n7.
