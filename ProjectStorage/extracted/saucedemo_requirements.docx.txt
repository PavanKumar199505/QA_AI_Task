SauceDemo Functional Requirements
Title: SauceDemo Functional Requirements
Version: 1.1
Author: QA Team
Date: June 22, 2025
1. Overview
This document specifies the functional requirements for the SauceDemo web application, a demo e-commerce platform designed for testing automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Playwright). The application simulates an online shopping experience with user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and checkout processes.
2. Main Features
Login Screen: A secure login page with fields for username and password, supporting multiple user types for testing scenarios.
Product Catalog: A browsable inventory displaying product names, descriptions, prices, images, and “Add to Cart” buttons, with sorting options by name (A-Z, Z-A) and price (low to high, high to low).
Shopping Cart View: A cart page listing added products with options to remove items, continue shopping, or proceed to checkout, including a badge showing item count.
Checkout Process: A multi-step checkout with:
Customer information form (first name, last name, postal code).
Order overview summarizing items, prices, and total (with tax).
Confirmation screen displaying a success message.
Navigation Menu: A sidebar menu with links for “All Items,” “About” (external Sauce Labs page), “Logout,” and “Reset App State.”
Social Media Links: Footer links to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn for external engagement.
3. User Actions
Login: Users can log in with valid or invalid credentials, with distinct behaviors for different user types (standard, locked-out, problem, performance glitch).
Browse Products: Users can view the product catalog, sort items by name or price, and access product details.
Manage Cart: Users can add multiple products to the cart, remove items, and view the cart’s contents.
Checkout: Users can fill out the checkout information form, review the order summary, and submit to complete the order.
Navigate: Users can access the sidebar menu to return to the inventory, visit the About page, log out, or reset the application state.
Interact with Social Links: Users can click footer links to visit social media pages.
4. Edge Cases
Invalid Credentials: Attempting login with incorrect username/password displays an error message (e.g., “Username and password do not match”).
Locked-Out User: Login attempt with locked_out_user displays a specific error (e.g., “Sorry, this user has been locked out”).
Problem User: Login with problem_user triggers UI issues (e.g., broken images or incorrect product data) for testing.
Performance Glitch User: Login with performance_glitch_user simulates delays (5–10 seconds) for performance testing.
Empty Cart Checkout: Attempting checkout with an empty cart displays an appropriate error or prevents progression.
Invalid ZIP Code: Entering an invalid postal code (e.g., empty or non-numeric) in the checkout form triggers a validation error.
Network Failure: Simulating network issues during order submission displays a retry option or error message.
5. Credentials for Testing
The following credentials are provided for testing different scenarios:
Standard User:
Username: standard_user
Password: secret_sauce
Behavior: Full access to all features.
Locked-Out User:
Username: locked_out_user
Password: secret_sauce
Behavior: Denied access with a locked-out error.
Problem User:
Username: problem_user
Password: secret_sauce
Behavior: Experiences UI or functional issues (e.g., broken images).
Performance Glitch User:
Username: performance_glitch_user
Password: secret_sauce
Behavior: Simulates slow response times.
6. Acceptance Criteria
All main features (login, product catalog, cart, checkout, navigation, social links) are functional and accessible with standard_user.
User actions are consistently executable across supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Edge cases are handled with clear, actionable error messages or expected behaviors.
Test credentials enable distinct testing scenarios as described.
UI elements include unique identifiers (IDs/classes) for automation testing reliability.
